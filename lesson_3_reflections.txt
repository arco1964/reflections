When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Could be that changes are not finished yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork:	get my own version of a repository on GitHub from another developer
    clone:	copy repository from GitHub to local or local to local
    branch:	set up new line of changes on local repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    when going off-line it's always good to have latest remote state

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Maybe use DropBox or GoogleDocs

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Work on your own: master
    Work with different people: branches
