What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git saves one cohesive set of files with each commit because it takes the
    content into account, Google Docs etc. don't bother with content and just
    stores versions of separate files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log
    git diff f19cb1b80fe27e938e4d72770ca0a42f25e99ecc b0678b161fcf74467ed3a63110557e3d6229cfa6

    git diff <first commit> <second commit>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
